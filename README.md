# LifeChain 🚑🔗

LifeChain is a decentralized healthcare record management system built on blockchain technology. It ensures secure, tamper-proof, and patient-centric access to medical records across hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare providers.

## 🧠 Project Vision

Modern healthcare data is often fragmented, insecure, and inaccessible to patients when they need it most. LifeChain aims to:

- Provide patients full control over their health records.
- Ensure interoperability among healthcare providers.
- Use blockchain for transparent, immutable medical data storage.
- Empower healthcare analytics through permissioned access to anonymized data.
